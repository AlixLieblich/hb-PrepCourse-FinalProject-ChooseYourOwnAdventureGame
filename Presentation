Presentation Notes:

- My game is a Choose Your Own Adventure Game

  - My game is based on a joke that I heard which stated that Elon      Musk is just a Martian trying to get home

- The main rule is to select between capitalized
  options when the game presesnts you an OPTION

- An important element of the game to me was to be able to go
  backwards and forwards as the user sees fit. I accomplished 
  this by setting all my OPTION phrases to the variable choice, 
  so that I was then able to print the variable choice to give
  the illusion of remaining at that point in the story, even if
  the code was printing from not that spot

    - I used this in order to give the user to option to take notes
      in a notebook, and when they are done adding or viewing their
      notebook, they are given the exact option from before opening
      the notebook

    - I used this in order to make sure the code does not break when
      a user enters a typo /  doesn't select a capitalized option; in that case, an error message pops up and the the code prints the variable option, which will give the user the same options from before the mistake

    - I used this in order to give the user the option to GO BACK if 
      they deem the path they have chosen to be dangerous or will not 
      end in victory - they can select GO BACK and they code will bring them back to a previous option

- The most interesting / challening part to me was working on 
  making the game interesting; I attempted to solve this 
  problem by adding in extra code elements throughout

    - I added in an option for the user to add notes to a notebook
      to keep track of what the Narrator calls clues throughout; I
      did this so that the user can try to make smarter choices 
      throughout the game in order to accomplish the goal of 
      "regaining your lost memories"; additionally, I tried to use
      the Narrators tone to help the user not make bad decisions

    - I added in a computer game, rock paper scissors, while the
      rocket is on its way to Mars

        - I tried to make this as user friendly as possible by 
          making it a while loop game so that you can play as 
          many times as you want, and see the overall scores; and
          then be able to quit at any time

    - I added in an interactive scene to see your appearance 
      in a puddle

    - I added in a Shoot element when boarding the rocket

    - I added in interactive dialogue scenes so you can feel
      like a part of the conversations

    - I added in Personality quiz to determine if you are a
      faerie or not (the answer is No 100% of the time though)
      
    - I used time.sleep() in order to make the narration print          indvidually to make it more story like
